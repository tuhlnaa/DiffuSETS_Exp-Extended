# DiffuSETS

Experiment code of paper [**_DiffuSETS: 12-lead ECG Generation Conditioned on Clinical Text Reports and Patient-Specific Information_**](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05932)

**Prerequisities** can be found at [Our Huggingface🤗 Hub](https://huggingface.co/Laiyf/DiffuSETS). Put them under the root of this repo as `./prerequisites/`.

## Inference 

Run inference accessing OpenAI api (more flexible):
```sh
python DiffuSETS_inference.py config/all.json
```

For configuration and input settings see this [section](#configurations).

Quick generation using pre-extracted conditions (no api requesting, but make sure you have downloaded prerequisites for inference):
```sh
python -m test_scripts.diversity
```

## Training

Training script is `DiffuSETS_train.py`, can be launched through 

```sh
python DiffuSETS_train.py config/all.json
```

For configuration settings see this [section](#configurations).

## Experiment

All scripts concerning with our experiments are included in `./test_scripts/`, please take a look freely.

## Configurations

The scripts of `DiffuSETS_train.py` and `DiffuSETS_inference.py` rely on configuration in json format to set up dependency paths and hyper parameters. 

Note that training and inference settings are written in ONE configuration file, so as to ensure the hyper parameters of UNET are the same.

Below is a example of settings with detailed explanation , you can alter it to meet with your environment and design. **Reminder**: `@key` is comment to `key`, so there is **NO** need to be included in the formal configuration file.
